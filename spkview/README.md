# SPK Viewer

Python 3 script to view and explore **chunks** and **game objects** in **SPK** files from **Hitman C47**.
Useful for **researching** the SPK format.

The script uses and requires the [wxPython](https://www.wxpython.org) GUI toolkit.

## Usage

To open an SPK file with the script, put the **name of the SPK file** as a **command-line argument**.

If Python is setup correctly, you might also be able to **drag the SPK file and drop it on spkview.py** using your file manager.

You can also change the name of the default SPK file path by finding and modifying the **defaultfilename** variable.
