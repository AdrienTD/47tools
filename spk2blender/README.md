Blender 2.79 script for importing geometries from Pack.SPK file

* Note that this script is buggy, slow and uses a lot of RAM!
* You need to change the filepath in the defaultfilename variable.
* The size of the imported geometry might be very large, you will have to resize the root objects to a smaller size first.
* No textures/materials imported!
